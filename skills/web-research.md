## Web Research Procedure

Research the topic thoroughly using multiple search queries.

### Step 1: Initial Search
Use web_search with 2-3 different phrasings of the query to get diverse results.

### Step 2: Deep Dive
For the top 3 most relevant results, use fetch_page to get full content.
Extract key facts, data points, and quotes.

### Step 3: Synthesis
Combine findings into a concise briefing. Lead with the answer,
then supporting evidence. Cite sources. Keep it under 5 sentences
for voice delivery — offer to elaborate if asked.
